# Libtimed

A library to interact with the json:api API of [timed](https://github.com/adfinis/timed-backend)

This is work in progress.

## Examples

There are examples in `./examples`, run them with `poetry run ./examples/<EXAMPLE>.py`
The examples might not be perfect python code.

## Plannings

In relationships, we actually want to define a model, that way we prevent any issues from resource_name + s being wrong
